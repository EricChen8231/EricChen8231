# Hi, I'm Eric Chen

I'm a Computer Science / Computer Engineering student currently working on supervised fine tuning of a large language model for code generation. This project focuses on training with gold standard demonstrations derived from large scale open source codebases, with particular emphasis on functional correctness, structural coherence, and reasoning across complex, multi file systems.
