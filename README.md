# Hi, I'm Eric Chen

I'm a PDP student at USC Viterbi School of Engineering. 
- Currently working on supervised fine tuning of a large language model for code generation focusing on training with gold standard demonstrations derived from large scale open source codebases, with particular emphasis on functional correctness, structural coherence, and reasoning across complex, multi file systems.
